/**
 * TypeORM config file
 *
 * README!
 * What is this?
 * So far, you have seen various config files including `.eslintignore`, `.eslintrc`, etc.
 * Config files determine and control the behaviour of libraries.
 * As for TypeORM, it is no different than most libraries. It requires a config file to tell it:
 *  - where to find the database
 *  - what the credentials of the database are
 *  - where to find entities, migrations, seed files
 *  - etc...
 *
 * It is not necessary to fully understand each configuration for now. The purpose
 * is to expose you to the idea of using a config file to govern the behaviour of a program.
